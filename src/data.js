In the beginning of the pandemic, we initiated the Work from Home movement project.
WFH is a research app designed to answer the question of whether working from home has caused us to move more or less. This year we have been featured in SVT on two occasions, and we have continued with data analysis of collected data.
Stay tuned for upcoming publications!
